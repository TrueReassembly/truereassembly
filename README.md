I am a 17 year old developer from Wales, I specialize in backend development and spigot / papermc development. I am currently a developer for LeoneMC and am working on my own server.

My public GitHub profile is not representative of my skills as a developer as most of my modern code is in private repositories. I intend to contribute to Open-Source projects when I find time.
