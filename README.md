I am a 18 year old developer from Wales, I specialize in backend development and spigot / papermc development. I am currently a developer for LeoneMC and am working on my own server.

My public GitHub profile is not representative of my skills as a developer as most of my modern code is in private repositories. I intend to contribute to Open-Source projects when I find time.

My portfolio website can be found [here](https://reassembly.dev). Please note that it is not that good as I am not a fullstack developer (yet) and it is my first time using both React and TypeScript. I want to update it soon.
